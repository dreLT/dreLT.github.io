I am a junior front-end web developer living in Brooklyn, NY, with more than three years experience developing websites/web applications. I have a strong background hand-coding HTML5, CSS3, and SASS, developing Wordpress themes from the ground up, coding responsive layouts, and experience in Javascript, jQuery, and AngularJS. I love building my skills, both by staying up to date with new technologies and trends and learning from colleagues, and am looking forward to working in a team environment.

I am currently looking for work! Please see my [GitHub](https://github.com/dreLT/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreleith), and feel free to reach me at [andreleithnyc@gmail.com](mailto:andreleithnyc@gmail.com)
