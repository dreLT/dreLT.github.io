## Explanation

A single-page web application for time management, built with Javascript and AngularJS ontop of a MeanJS stack.  

This app's functionality is based on the Pomodoro time management method, which recommends 25-minutes work periods followed by 5-minute breaks. The app keeps track of these periods with countdown timers, which the user can start, pause, and reset at any time. It also features a task list (in the form of sticky notes); tasks can be added, marked "done", and deleted.

**The app is live**: [http://pomodoromgmt.herokuapp.com/](http://pomodoromgmt.herokuapp.com/)

**Important**:
To see the task list in action, simply login with the following credentials -
Username: andre
Password: abcd1234

To add a task, simply click "Add Task". Hover over a task to see options to edit, delete, and mark a task "complete". Once a task is marked complete, hover over it to see options to undo marking it complete, or delete the task.
