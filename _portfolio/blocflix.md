## Explanation

A fully responsive Wordpress site I developed for the Historic Tax Credit Coalition. The site is live at [http://historiccredit.com](http://historiccredit.com). I developed the site mostly from scratch ontop of a blank Wordpress theme, hand coding most of the HTML, CSS (used SASS), media queries, and PHP (for Wordpress functionality). The theme responds appropriately to all screen resolutions. In terms of Wordpress functionality, I tailored the theme to meet the needs of the client, using custom post types and taxonomies for the various categories of posts required (Advocacy, News and Members posts). I also implemented custom fields to give the client the ability to edit most of the site's content via the Wordpress dashboard.
